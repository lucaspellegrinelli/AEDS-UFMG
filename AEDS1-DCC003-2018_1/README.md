# Algorithms and Data Structures I - 2018/1

Here you'll be able to find most of the codes I had to make in the AEDS I 2018/1 couse in UFMG.

Most of the work will be pratical activities (labled as "TP [date]") sent by the professor where I needed to send back online through Moodle.

There will also be the code for my final project for the class, cryptography/steganography themed.
