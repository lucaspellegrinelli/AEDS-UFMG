# Algorithms and Data Structures I - 2018/1

Here you'll be able to find most of the codes I had to make in the AEDS I 2018/1 couse in UFMG.

Most of the work will be pratical activities (labled as "TP [date]") sent by the professor where I needed to send back online through Moodle (online plataform to send activities to the teacher).

There will also be the code for my final project for the class, cryptography/steganography themed where I needed to make the code and some documentation of the code.
